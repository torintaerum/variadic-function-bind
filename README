This sample code included will definitely build using g++ version 4.6.1 on ubuntu. It should build with most relatively modern versions of g++.
It will NOT build using MSVC as variadic templates haven't been added yet (at least as of VS 2010).

To build:

    make

To run:

    ./test

Expected output:

results using std:
get_val(1,2,3,4,5) after set_val(11,222,3333,44444,555555): 573526
vfunc bound to instance of foo: 3
vfunc bound to instance of bar: 9

results using asgard:
get_val(1,2,3,4,5) after set_val(11,222,3333,44444,555555): 573526
vfunc bound to instance of foo: 3
vfunc bound to instance of bar: 9

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    return 0;
}
```
